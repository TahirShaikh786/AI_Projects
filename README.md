#                                                        Computer-Vision

### Some Packages to Work with Computer Vision 
>1. pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python<br /> 2. pip install matplotlib<br /> 3. pip install seaborn<br /> 4. pip install scipy<br /> 5. pip install imutils

### Computer Vision Library
>1. Opencv :- OpenCv is a Free, Open-source computer vision library used for tasks like image and video analysis.<br /><br />2. Pillow :- Pillow is a python library used for working with images, It allows you to open, manipulate, and save various image file formats. Whether you want to resize, enhance, or convert imagesd, Pillow makes it easy. It's like a digital toolkit for images editing in python.<br /><br />3. Scikit image :- It provides a wide range of functions and tools to work with images, including tasks like filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction.<br /><br />4. SciPy (Scitific-Python) :- SciPy is a Python Library used for scientific and technical computing. It provides a wide range of functions and tools for tasks like numerical Integration, Optimization, signal processing, and more. think of it as a Swiss Army knife for Scientific and engineering calculations in Python.<br /><br />5. NumPy (Numerical-Python) :- NumPy is a Python Library for numerical computations. It Offers a Powerfull array object call "ndarray" that allows yout to perform mathematical operations on large datasets effieciently. Think of it as the go-to-toolbox for number crunching and data manipulation in Python.
